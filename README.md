# Real Time Emotion-recognition-and-object-detection
Facial expression recognition is done using deep learning with the convolutional neural network approach CNN and automatic detection of faces and drawing bounding boxes around them are done using different data sets.
This code detect object and recognise after capturing image from user camera.
I made my code in google colab platform.
Google colab platform is very user friendly for python user.
I take help from Edureka and NIT, Raipur professor Dr. B.K.Singh.
