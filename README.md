# Real Time Emotion-recognition-and-object-detection
Facial expression recognition is done using deep learning with the convolutional neural network approach CNN and automatic detection of faces and drawing bounding boxes around them are done using different data sets.
This programe detect object and recognise emotion after capturing image through webcam.
I made my programe in google colab platform.
Google colab platform is very user friendly for python user.
I took help from Edureka and NIT, Raipur professor Dr. B.K.Singh.
